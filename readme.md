This Dapp is for the NFT presale and minting.

Created as part of the [Learn Web3 DAO](https://www.learnweb3.io/) Sophmore Tack.

This code was written for NFT Collection Tutorial

## Features

- There should only exist 20 Crypto Dev NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
- User should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
- Whitelisted users, should have a 5 min presale period before the actual sale where they are guaranteed 1 NFT per transaction. (Actual whitelist contract is in a separate repo)
- There should be a website which users can visit for the NFT Minting.

## Technology/Websites used:

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
